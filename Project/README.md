DataSets:

Fraudulent Transactions
https://www.kaggle.com/ntnu-testimon/paysim1

The dataset contains information regarding various transactions and attributes related to these transactions like, the type of transactions (Cash-In, Cash-Out, Debit, Payment or transfer), the details of the user who initiated the transaction and the recipient information. The dataset also includes attributes, such as

isFraud : This attribute describes  the fraudulent behavior of the agents by taking control of customers accounts and trying to empty the funds by transferring to another account and then cashing out of the system.

isFlaggedFraud:  This attribute aims to  control massive transfers from one account to another and flags illegal attempts.

Data Analysis Challenges:

Overarching goal: We want to classify and predict if a transaction is fraudulent using different approaches.

Main task 1:  Classification and prediction of fraudulent transactions using existing data mining libraries (MapReduce).

Main task 2:  Using nearest neighbor classification to predict the fraudulent transaction.

Main task 3:  Improving the nearest neighbor classification to predict the fraudulent transaction using top-k pruning.
